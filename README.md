#  Python for CAD Automation

This is a personal toolkit of Python scripts designed to automate 3D part generation and export using popular CAD platforms like **FreeCAD** and **Fusion 360**. The goal is to streamline repetitive modeling tasks and enable parametric design through simple CSV or user input.

# ðŸš€ Why This Project?
As a mechanical engineering student, I wanted to reduce time spent on repetitive modeling by building my own Python-based CAD automation tools. This repo serves as a learning playground and a growing toolkit for design automation.

##  Whatâ€™s Included

### ðŸ“Œ FreeCAD Tools
- **Washer/Spacer/Flange Generator**
  - Reads part parameters from a CSV file
  - Creates 3D models of washers, spacers, and flanges
  - Adds bolt holes and lips for flanges
  - Exports to `.STEP` and `.STL`
  - Generates a complete `BOM.csv`


---

### ðŸ“Œ Fusion 360 Add-ins 
- **Bolt Generator**
- **Gear Generator**

These are custom Python scripts built using Fusion 360â€™s API, designed for generating fasteners and gear profiles parametrically.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- FreeCAD Folder
- Fusion 360 Folder

Contain all the relevant files. 
- For FreeCAD, I have included 'input_parts.csv' as that format has to be followed for creating the input file. Bill of Material and exported STEP and STL file for washer, flange and spacer. Along with this, Python scipt for the same has been uploaded as well. A video demonstrating the workinf of the code and export (output) is shown as well. 
- The Fusion 360 folder has Python scripts for 'Bolt Generator' as well as 'Gear Generator'. Two demonstrative videos for using Scripts in the Fusion 360 workspace have also been attached.

## ðŸ’¡ How to Use

### âœ… FreeCAD Scripts
1. Open FreeCAD.
2. Go to: `Utilities > Add-ins > Macros`
3. Create a new macro and paste the script 
4. Update the `input_csv` and `output_dir` paths inside the script.
5. Run the macro.
6. Parts will be exported and BOM generated in the specified output folder.

### âœ… Fusion 360 Add-ins
1. Open Fusion 360.
2. Go to: `Tools > Scripts and Add-ins`
3. Copy the script in the a newly created Script (Python)
4. Run or customize as needed.
